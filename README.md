# M5CardputerAI
A very simple project that utilizes AI APIs to turn M5Stack's M5Cardputer into an AI-buddy-gadget-device.

Ask anything, and it'll be answered. This project utilizes Cohere's AI API to get your questions and return complete answers based on Cohere's Generative AI capabilities.

At the initial version, it's being used the "Generate" API, which is no longer maintained by Cohere, but still works until this date, 6th May 2024.

Theres a migration guide at Cohere's documentation to start using the "Chat" API instead (https://docs.cohere.com/docs/migrating-from-cogenerate-to-cochat). Feel free to migrate it! It will be awesome! :)

Adding sound generation from text through M5Cardputer's speakers is on the ROADMAP. Though, because of my lack of time due to work, it will take some time. If you want, feel free to add this functionality as well.

Anything you'll need to know about Cohere API, will be found here:

Let's rock!
